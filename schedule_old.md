## Schedule of the first week (14-18 August 2017)

Lectures will start in AU206 (Joensuu) and SN200 (Kuopio) on **Monday 14.8.2017 10:00**.

All participants will participate on same lectures on first two days (Monday, Tuesday). Later on participants can choose between speech or bioinformatics track (Wednesday, Thursday). However practicals of the tracks are only kept in their respective locations (Speech practicals in Joensuu, Bioinformatic practicals in Kuopio).

#### **Fundamentals of Machine Learning** 

All lectures of Monday and Tuesday take place in AU206 (Joensuu) and SN200 (Kuopio).
